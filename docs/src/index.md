# AtticGreek

*A rigorously defined orthography for texts in the archaic Attic alphabet*.

Highlights:

- implement the MID Orthography interface, with semantic tokenization of text in Attic Greek
- uses Unicode in form `:NFKC` whererever codepoints are defined
- mimics print publication practice insupplementing missing characters with the ASCII code point sumarized below.


| Code point | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| h | rough breathing |
| ê | ε with circumflex |
| ô | ο with circuflex |

    
!!! note
    In the Attic alphabet, all iotas are adscript.
    There is no character for smooth breathing:  the aspirate (rough breathing) is explicitly marked, so that word-initial vowels are unaspirated by default.
